//LOOPS class24
//loops in terraform used to help to create multiple resource blocks
//count is the keyword used to iterate the loop
count.index is the index

resource "aws_instance" "sample" {
  count            = 3
  ami              = var.AMI[count.index]
  instance_type    = var.INSTANCE_TYPE[count.index]
} //it iterate 3 times ,count offers index-can be referred as count.index
//index starts from 0
//starting from terraform 0.13 v count is available for module also

//just an example
//variable "AMI" {
//  default = ["ami1","ami2","ami3"] //give ur ami ids
