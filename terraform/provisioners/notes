TERRAFORM PROVISIONERS
//used to provision certain tasks after resource creation
 - connect to instance and perform some commands ,copy some files,install some services .. to instances that r created
 - provisioner is a sub block in resource
 - resource attributes can be used inside provisioner and those should be referred as self.attribute
    self.public_ip
 - provisioners by default are create-time-provisioners ,we can also specify destroy-time-provisioners by using
   when = destroy
      provisioner "local-exec" {
        when    = destroy
        command = "echo 'Destroy-time provisioner'"
      }
 - we can make multiple provisioners and multiple types also

   # Copies the myapp.conf file to /etc/myapp.conf
   provisioner "file" {
     source      = "conf/myapp.conf"
     destination = "/etc/myapp.conf"
   }

   provisioner "local-exec" {
     command = "echo ${aws_instance.web.private_ip} >> private_ips.txt"
   }
