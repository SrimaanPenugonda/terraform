-object format storage
-object over http layer- means we can access in http way

#TERRAFORM REMOTE STATE FILE
#choosing remote state of s3 cause problem - because it doesn't have locking mechanism.
-if multiple people r running same code updating same state file - it leads to corrupting
-AWS doesn't support locking mechanism
-DYNAMODB - Dynamodb integrated with S3 -supports locking mechanism
-Dynamodb - its first software db service
-create dyanamodb table
